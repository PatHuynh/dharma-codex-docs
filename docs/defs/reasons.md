### Reason

That which is put forth as a reason

### Correct Reason

That which is the three modes

### Position property in proving that sound is impermanent

Sound is the faultless subject of interest in proving that sound is impermanent by reason of this and it is ascertained by valid cognition to only exist, in a manner similar to the way it is put forth, in relation to sound, by means of being mutually distinct from sound.

### Forward pervasion in proving that sound is impermanent

There is a correct similar example incorporating both reason and predicate in proving sound is impermanent by reason of this; this is related to impermanent; and this is ascertained by valid cognition to only exist, similar to the way it is put forth, for solely the similar class in proving sound is impermanent.

### Reverse pervasion in proving that sound is impermanent

There is a correct dissimilar example lacking both reason and predicate in proving that sound is impermanent by reason of this; this is related to impermanent; and this is ascertained by valid cognition as just not existing for the dissimilar class in proving that.

### Faultless subject of interest proving that sound is impermanent by reason of it being a product

That which is observed to be a common locus between what is held to be the basis of dispute in proving that sound is impermanent by reason of it being a product; and being [that where] there can be a person who, having ascertained with valid cognition that it is a product, is interested in whether or not it is impermanent

### Correct reason of effect

It is a correct affirming reason proving that; and there is a possible common locus between what is held to be the explicit predicate proving that by reason of it and its cause.

### Correct reason of nature

A correct reason proving that and if something is held as the explicit predicate in proving that by reason of it, it is necessarily intrinsically one with it.

### Correct reason of non-observation

It is a correct reason proving that; and a common locus between that held as the explicit predicate proving that by reason of it and a negation exists.
